# Projects

## Feature Selection
 - Use genetic algorithm and many other algorithm for feature selection in a dataset where number of features > 30

## Agent-based optimisation for Machine Learning
- Use Agent-based approach for optimising weights of a neural network for a specific task (Ex: Flappy Bird)

## Evolution of social norms
- [How coopeation evolves?](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0219525916500156) Replicate and improve the results of this article.
