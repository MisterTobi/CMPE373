# CMPE373 Agent Based Modeling
Complexity arises from simplicity, so it is our job to do reverse engineering and making the complex simple again :)

Nobel laureate Philip Anderson said: "**More is different!**". German scientist and engineer Jochen Fromm:
 - one water molecule is not fluid 
 - one gold atom is not metallic 
 - one neuron is not conscious 
 - one amino acid is not alive
> "Emergence" describes the ability of individual components of a large system to work together to give rise to dramatic and diverse behaviour. (Read more at: https://phys.org/news/2014-10-remarkable-simplicity-complexity.html#jCp )
